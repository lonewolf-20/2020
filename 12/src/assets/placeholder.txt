In a production version of this game, we would need to create the following image assets:

1. Player sprites:
   - player.png - Player character for underground
   - player_with_mask.png - Player character wearing a radiation mask

2. Environmental tiles:
   - underground_tile.png - Tile for underground areas
   - aboveground_tile.png - Tile for above ground areas
   - elevator.png - Elevator for changing levels

3. Game items:
   - mask.png - Radiation mask item
   - oxygen_tank.png - Oxygen tank item
   - tomato_seed.png - Tomato seed item
   - lettuce_seed.png - Lettuce seed item
   - watering_can.png - Watering can item
   - solar_panel.png - Solar panel item (inventory)
   - solar_panel_placed.png - Solar panel (placed on ground)
   - tomato_crop.png - Tomato plant at different growth stages
   - lettuce_crop.png - Lettuce plant at different growth stages
   - market.png - Marketplace building

These images would need to be placed in the public/images/ directory for the game to access them.

For now, we're implementing the game mechanics and will replace these with actual assets later.
